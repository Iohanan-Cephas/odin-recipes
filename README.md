# Odin Recipes

This project consists of a website that hosts recipes.

You can use it to search, add, edit, and remove recipes in a simple way. The objective of this project is to demonstrate my skills and proficiency in basic HTML and CSS, showcasing what I have learned. Over time, I plan to expand this project with more features and continue improving my coding skills.
